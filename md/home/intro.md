# Samyabrata Maji

I am full-stack developer from India. Currently, I'm working as a freelance software developer, helping startups build their products fast and at scale. [See work](/work).<!--, or [atleast try to](/blog/on-scaling-software). [See work](/work). -->

<!-- I love to build things. Most of my products just fail, but I enjoy making them so... 🤷. Some of them end up being useful — [budgetbee](https://www.budgetbee.site), [codeslice](#) and [typer](#). -->
