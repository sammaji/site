# Sam Maji — Software dev, tech generalist.

21 yo, software developer, cse student, based in India. Self-taught. Loves to code. Build things, break things.

Currently, I'm working as a freelance software developer, helping early stage startups build their products fast and at scale, without breaking too many things.

<!-- I love to build things. Most of my products just fail, but I enjoy making them so... 🤷. Some of them end up being useful — [budgetbee](https://www.budgetbee.site), [codeslice](#) and [typer](#). -->
