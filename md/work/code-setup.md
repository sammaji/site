# Code setup

## OS

I use arch btw.

My primary reason to switch to linux over windows was simplicity.

## Desktop

Switching to arch linux, I decided to use a tiling window manager.

## Code editor

I use neovim as my primary code editor. I was already using vim for a while, and decided to switch from vscode to neovim.
