# We are building a fast, cross-platform file manager.

Our goal is to solve most of the problems with windows file explorer like slow search, no multi-pane views and unreliable copying or moving.

### Fast fuzzy searching
Quickly navigate through your files and folders by fuzzy search.

UPDATE: This is done, takes around 100ms to search 100k files & folders for me - [see video](https://x.com/sammaji15/status/1951527634254397920).

### Multi-pane view
Multi-tab, multi-pane, quick previews, tree view, etc.

### Reliable copies and moves
Large copy won't be suspended by the system, rollbacks in case of interrupt, overall more reliable.

### Themes & customization
Minial ui, easy to customize.

## Open source?

I plan to open source the project soon! (As soon as I clean my sloppy code.)

## Supported platforms

- Windows
- Linux (we are hardcore linux fanbois).
- MacOS (not fully tested, yet)

## Waitlist

I'll notify you when atomo is stable and ready to use â†’ [Atomo waitlist](https://atomo.sammaji.tech).
