# Artvy.

Artvy ([artvy.ai](https://artvy.ai)) is a free site to generate ai artworks in different styles. They also provide a gallery of ai generated artworks, blogs, latest news and more.

I built their ai image generation pipeline. You can try it [here](https://www.artvy.ai/free/ai-art-generator).

They had built their site on Webflow and Airtable. To reduce costs and improve latency, I helped migrate their site to NextJS and PayloadCMS, deploy on dedicated hardware and migrate all data to PostGreSQL and BunnyCDN, with just 5 minutes of downtime.

Also did some technical SEO work. Their page now recieves around 70k monthly page views.
