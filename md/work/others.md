These are some smalls projects I worked on.

## Reverse product search (for an upwork client)

Built a reverse product search engine. It's a simple search tool where users can upload their product image and get a list of similar available products. Used GCP Vertex AI for reverse searching.

## Form Builder (for an upwork client)

Built a form builder (ui only) that creates forms much like Typeform.

## Chapterize (for TokTools)

Built a simple tool to fetch transcripts from Youtube api and convert them into timestamps using AI.

## Full-text search + Crypto payment integration (for Govidigo)

Built a full-text search for a course website (written in Svelte). Integrated algolia with firebase to perform full text search and filtering on course documents.

Integrated Nowpayments for crypto payments on the website.

## Real estate letter generation (for Moflo)
